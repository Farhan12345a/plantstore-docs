# Prince Plants — API Documentation Demo 🌿👑

This repository contains a demo API documentation website for **Prince Plants**, a fictional plant store company.  
The site is built using **Fern** and demonstrates how a production-ready API landing page and reference documentation could be structured for a real customer.

This project is intended to showcase:
- A polished API landing page
- Clear developer onboarding and examples
- A clean, client-ready repository structure

---

## What’s included

- A custom API landing page written in MDX using Fern components
- Auto-generated API reference documentation from an OpenAPI (Swagger) spec
- Custom branding and styling for the Prince Plants product
- Global custom JavaScript (floating action button)
- Example API requests in JavaScript and Python

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
- npm
- Fern CLI

Install the Fern CLI globally (bash) :

npm install -g fern-api


## Running the documentation locally

From the fern/ directory, start the development server (bash):

fern docs dev

This will launch a local documentation site in your browser.
Changes to MDX files, styles, or configuration will automatically reload.

The main landing page is written in MDX and located in:
fern/pages/

The landing page uses Fern components such as:
- Cards and CardGroups
- Steps
- Tabs
- Accordions
- Callouts (Note, Warning, Info)
You can edit content, reorder sections, or add new components directly in the MDX file.

The API reference is generated automatically from the OpenAPI specification located at:
fern/openapi/

To update the API documentation:
1. Modify the OpenAPI YAML file
2. Save the changes
3. Reload the docs site
Fern will regenerate the API reference automatically.

## Publishing the documentation:
When ready, the documentation can be published with:
fern docs publish
This deploys the site to the configured Fern domain.

Next, update _only the first subdomain_ of the `url` field defined in the [`docs.yml`](/fern/docs.yml) file to something other than `sample-demo-site`. The resulting URL should look something like `firstName-lastName-demo.docs.buildwithfern.com` and publish the docs site.
