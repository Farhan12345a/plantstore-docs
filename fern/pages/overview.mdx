      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        },
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Request failed: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const plants = await response.json();
    console.log(plants);
    ```
  </Step>

 <Step title="Create your first plant">
    Add a new plant to your catalog:

## Core API concepts

<Callout intent="info" title="Mental model">
  Prince Plants is resource-oriented. Plants are created, fetched by ID, updated, and searched by status.
</Callout>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plants">
    The Plant resource represents an item in your catalog.

    - Create plants with `POST /plant`
    - Fetch a plant by ID with `GET /plant/{plantId}`
    - Update or remove plants as inventory changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search & availability">
    Search endpoints allow filtering plants by availability status.

    Common statuses include:
    - available
    - pending
    - sold
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication">
    All endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token passed in the request headers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What is the Prince Plants API?" defaultOpen={true}>
    The Prince Plants API allows developers to programmatically manage a plant store’s catalog, inventory, and orders. 
    It provides RESTful endpoints for creating plants, updating availability, and retrieving plant data for storefronts or internal tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is this API intended for?">
    The API is designed for e-commerce developers, internal operations teams, and partners who want to integrate plant inventory 
    and order management into web or mobile applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I authenticate with the API?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create a new plant in the catalog?">
    You can create a plant by sending a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/plant</code> endpoint with details such as name, status, and category.
    The API returns the newly created plant object with a unique identifier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I search for plants by availability or status?">
    Yes. The <code>/plant/search/status</code> endpoint allows you to filter plants by status, such as available, pending, or sold.
    This is useful for powering storefront filters or internal inventory dashboards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are plant IDs generated?">
    Plant IDs are generated automatically by the system when a plant is created.
    These IDs are globally unique and should be used when retrieving, updating, or deleting plant records.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the API support pagination?">
    Yes. List and search endpoints support pagination to help manage large plant catalogs efficiently.
    Pagination parameters allow you to control page size and traversal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update or remove a plant?">
    Existing plants can be updated using a <code>PUT</code> request and removed with a <code>DELETE</code> request 
    to the <code>/plant/{'{plantId}'}</code> endpoint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed the rate limit?">
    If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response.
    Rate limits are enforced to ensure reliability and fair usage across all clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the API suitable for production use?">
    Yes. The Prince Plants API is designed for production workloads and is used internally to power our own plant storefront.
    High availability and consistent response times are core design goals.
